# Systemless TZData

Update your ROM's TZdata systemlessly. There is no XDA support thread for this one due to the module's simplicity, and I will release an update when I see that there is an available TZData update.



### Changelog:

#### v3

>Update for Magisk Manager 5.1.0

#### v2

>Updated to template 4

#### v1

>TZData updated to 2017B
